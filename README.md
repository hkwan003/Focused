Focused: Google chrome extension for productivity

#Introduction

Twas was finals week and the urge to go onto social media to procratinate was stronger than ever. I tried resisting from going onto facebook but it was just too hard. I even considered deactivating it for a few days but the thought of losing my communication with the outside world was too much to bear. So I resorted to download a few social media block extensions. What I quickly discovered is the simple implmentation that I desired wasn't out there so I decided to make my own. 

Enoy!!! :)
